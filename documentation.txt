###Buffer Size
1028kb (should be the best due to read ahead) (check using graphs)

### Fallocate (allocate size of file before aio)

Graph Results

### Intra-file writes (writing multiple lines to same file at same time)


### Batched aio (need to work on this there is a batched aio op)


### aio test under slow physical media


### aio test under (os w/o buffering) maybe file system



### io_uring basic comparison


### look into io_uring advanced features to improve performance


### Analysis of how normal cp -r works (strace)
